# Completion Notes

TL;DR

Your game my rules.

Thank you for getting me familiar with Adonis. Never used it before However, it is pretty close to common MVC monolith 
paradigms used in frameworks like Laravel + eloquent or Symfony . Interesting framework to play around btw.


As soon as You are challenging me for React frontend position I've decided to inject React instead of using vanilla ts 
or any other js lib. Also seems this example should utilize Adonis separation of views, so I've decided not
to use SPA but better inject differently bootstrapped react instances twice. Of course this is not a real case for such a product.


For the first task ive transpiled css to sass and thought about applying BEM however this obviously would look little 
verbose then imho. So I ve just scoped css needed for bacon and used styled components for form.

For the second and further tasks I ve used both BEM with Adonis component and styled-components with Material-UI just 
for demonstration purposes.

Tried to structure form dependencies like in real life. You may think it is overcomplicated but in general it is pretty well
scalable and reusable.

Thank you

* Please use real Github accounts, as we check for contribution history. However, if you want to stay anonymous, please send patch instead.
* We are not answering any questions about this test. Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
* The test is designed in a way, that can confuse you or seems weird, because we want to test you in a way worse environment than you will work on a daily basis. It's also not a representation of the tech stack we are using in real projects.

## Before you start
* Fork this repository, it needs to stay on Github, publicly available.
* The test is based on [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) a full stack Node.js framework, but you don't need to write any backend stuff, nor have any experience with Adonis or other similar framework.
* After installing the dependencies and running `npm run dev`, you should see a start page on http://localhost:3333. If something is wrong, you probably use a wrong version of Node.js.

### Task 1
On [/bacon](http://localhost:3333/bacon) you should see a page with beautiful slices of fried bacon, that comes from external source.

Create bacon cloning logic and attach it to **Yeah, I want more bacon!** button.

### Task 2
Take a look at [design file](./design.png) and recreate it. Use any way of writing styles you are comfortable with and pick `Roboto` as the font family.

By default Adonis support [PostCSS](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/assets-manager#setup-postcss), [SASS, Less and Stylus](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/assets-manager#setup-sass-less-and-stylus) you need to enable one of it, but it's just Webpack under the hood, so feel free to hook whatever you like the most.

### Task 3
Provide simple JS validation for checkout form created earlier.

### Task 4
Send form data to the `POST /order` endpoint and show success / error message based on API response.

Accepted data formats:
* Postal code: 00000
* Phone number: 000000000
* Credit card: 0000000000000000
* CVV: 000
* Exp. date: 00/00
